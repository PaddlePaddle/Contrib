Based on the flowers102 dataset, it takes only 30 mins to experience PaddleClas, include training varieties of backbone and pretrained model, SSLD distillation, and multiple data augmentation, Please refer to [Installation](install_en.md) to install at first.


## Preparation

* Enter insatallation dir.

```
cd path_to_PaddleClas
```

* Enter `dataset/flowers102`, download and decompress flowers102 dataset.

```shell
cd dataset/flowers102
# If you want to download from the brower, you can copy the link, visit it
# in the browser, download and then decommpress.
wget https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/data/flowers102.zip
unzip flowers102.zip
```

## Environment

### Download pretrained model

You can use the following commands to downdload the pretrained models.

```bash
mkdir pretrained
cd pretrained
wget https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/ResNet50_vd_pretrained.pdparams
wget https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/ResNet50_vd_ssld_pretrained.pdparams

cd ../
```

**Note**: If you want to download the pretrained models on Windows environment, you can copy the links to the browser and download.


## Training

* All experiments are running on the NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 single card.
* First of all, use the following command to set visible device.

If you use mac or linux, you can use the following command:

```shell
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

* If you use windows, you can use the following command.

```shell
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

* If you want to train on cpu device, you can modify the field `use_gpu: True` in the config file to `use_gpu: False`, or you can append `-o use_gpu=False` in the training command, which means override the value of `use_gpu` as False.


### Train from scratch

* Train ResNet50_vd

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/ResNet50_vd.yaml
```

If you want to train on cpu device, the command is as follows.

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/ResNet50_vd.yaml -o use_gpu=False
```

Similarly, for the following commands, if you want to train on cpu device, you can append `-o use_gpu=False` in the command.

The validation `Top1 Acc` curve is shown below.

### Finetune - ResNet50_vd pretrained model (Acc 79.12\%)

* Finetune ResNet50_vd model pretrained on the 1000-class Imagenet dataset

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/ResNet50_vd_finetune.yaml
```

The validation `Top1 Acc` curve is shown below

![](../../images/quick_start/r50_vd_pretrained_acc.png)

Compare with training from scratch, it improve by 65\% to 94.02\%


You can use the trained model to infer the result of image `docs/images/quick_start/flowers102/image_06739.jpg`. The command is as follows.


```shell
python3 tools/infer/infer.py \
    -i docs/images/quick_start/flowers102/image_06739.jpg \
    --model=ResNet50_vd \
    --pretrained_model="output/ResNet50_vd/best_model/ppcls" \
    --class_num=102
```

The output is as follows. Top-5 class ids and their scores are printed.

```
Current image file: docs/images/quick_start/flowers102/image_06739.jpg
    top1, class id: 0, probability: 0.5129
    top2, class id: 50, probability: 0.0671
    top3, class id: 18, probability: 0.0377
    top4, class id: 82, probability: 0.0238
    top5, class id: 54, probability: 0.0231
```

* Note: Results are different for different models, so you might get different results for the command.


### SSLD finetune - ResNet50_vd_ssld pretrained model (Acc 82.39\%)

Note: when finetuning model, which has been trained by SSLD, please use smaller learning rate in the middle of net.

```yaml
ARCHITECTURE:
    name: 'ResNet50_vd'
    params:
        lr_mult_list: [0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.6, 0.8]
pretrained_model: "./pretrained/ResNet50_vd_ssld_pretrained"
```

Tringing script

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/ResNet50_vd_ssld_finetune.yaml
```

Compare with finetune on the 79.12% pretrained model, it improve by 0.98\% to 95\%.


### More architecture - MobileNetV3

Training script

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/MobileNetV3_large_x1_0_finetune.yaml
```

Compare with ResNet50_vd pretrained model, it decrease by 5% to 90%. Different architecture generates different performance, actually it is a task-oriented decision to apply the best performance model, should consider the inference time, storage, heterogeneous device, etc.


### RandomErasing

Data augmentation works when training data is small.

Training script

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/ResNet50_vd_ssld_random_erasing_finetune.yaml
```

It improves by 1.27\% to 96.27\%


### Distillation

* The ResNet50_vd model pretrained on previous chapter will be used as the teacher model to train student model. Save the model to specified directory, command as follows:

```shell
cp -r output/ResNet50_vd/19/  ./pretrained/flowers102_R50_vd_final/
```

* Use `extra_list.txt` as unlabeled data, Note:
    * Samples in the `extra_list.txt` and `val_list.txt` don't have intersection
    * Because of in the source code, label information is unused, This is still unlabeled distillation
    * Teacher model use the pretrained_model trained on the flowers102 dataset, and student model use the MobileNetV3_large_x1_0 pretrained model(Acc 75.32\%) trained on the ImageNet1K dataset


```yaml
total_images: 7169
ARCHITECTURE:
    name: 'ResNet50_vd_distill_MobileNetV3_large_x1_0'
pretrained_model:
    - "./pretrained/flowers102_R50_vd_final/ppcls"
    - "./pretrained/MobileNetV3_large_x1_0_pretrained/”
TRAIN:
    file_list: "./dataset/flowers102/train_extra_list.txt"
```

Final training script

```shell
python3 tools/train.py -c ./configs/quick_start/R50_vd_distill_MV3_large_x1_0.yaml
```

It significantly imporve by 6.47% to 96.47% with more unlabeled data and teacher model.

### All accuracy
